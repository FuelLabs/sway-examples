## Overview

This repository is designed to showcase full-stack examples of the Sway Language that users can reference. 

All examples are maintained by official Sway contributors and will be kept up to date with the latest working version of the Fuel development stack. Each application includes a functional Sway program, a frontend using Typescript, and tests written in Rust, all with the help of the SDKs.

- An example demonstrating how to mint and burn native NFTs with images stored on IPFS.
- [demo](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-examples/nft/)

#### Token Airdrop
