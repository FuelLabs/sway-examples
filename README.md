## Overview

This repository is designed to showcase full-stack examples of the Sway Language that users can reference. 

All examples are maintained by official Sway contributors and will be kept up to date with the latest working version of the Fuel development stack. Each application includes a functional Sway program, a frontend using the ts-sdk, and tests written in Rust.

## Examples

#### [NFT Launcher](./nft/README.md)

- An example demonstrating how to mint and burn native NFTs with images stored on IPFS.
- [demo](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-examples/nft/)

#### Token Airdrop

- Learn how to work with merkle trees in Sway to distrubute native tokens across multiple addresses.

#### Counter Dapp

- A simple example to demonstrate basic functionality.

## Coming Soon

- SwayFarm
- Predicate-based Orderbook
- Voting DAO
- Constant Product AMM

## Using an Example
