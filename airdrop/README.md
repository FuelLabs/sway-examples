This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-fuels`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/tree/master/packages/create-fuels).

### You can interact with the Airdrop Dapp at this [demo](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-examples/pr-preview/pr-18/airdrop/) link.

## Getting Started

1. Firstly, create a new file `.env.local` at the root of the `/airdrop` directory and copy the contents from `.env.example` to this file.


2. Start the Fuel development server. This server will start a local Fuel node and provide hot-reloading for your smart contracts.

```bash
npm run fuels:dev
```

3. Start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to Testnet
